    <h2>How to Play the Bipartite Graph Game</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Objective:</strong> Determine if the given graph is bipartite or
      not. A graph is bipartite if its nodes can be divided into two sets such
      that no two nodes within the same set are connected by an edge.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Steps to Play:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose a Graph:</strong> Select a graph by clicking on one of
        the Graph options (Graph 1, Graph 2, or Graph 3).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Set Difficulty:</strong> Pick the desired difficulty level
        (Easy, Medium, or Hard) using the dropdown menu. Each difficulty has
        different graph configurations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Color the Nodes:</strong> Use the Color 1 and Color 2 pickers to
        assign two colors to the nodes. Your goal is to try and color the graph
        such that no two connected nodes share the same color.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Submit Your Answer:</strong> Use the "Is the graph bipartite?"
        dropdown to select either Yes or No, based on your analysis of the
        graph. Click Submit Answer to check your response.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Get Feedback:</strong> The feedback box will inform you if your
        answer is correct or incorrect. Try again if needed!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reset the Game:</strong> Click Reset to clear your current
        progress and start fresh.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Look for Odd Cycles: If the graph contains an odd-length cycle, it is
        not bipartite. Odd cycles in a graph is a cycle (a closed loop of edges
        and vertices) that contains an odd number of vertices. Eg, a triangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Experiment with different graphs and difficulties to improve your
        understanding of bipartite graphs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the node coloring as a tool to visualize and verify your answer.
